Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
==============================

Summary
-------

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
1. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible
   manner
1. PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions
to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
